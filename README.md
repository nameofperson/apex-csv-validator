# CSV Data Validator and Uploader (Salesforce)

## Description

This is a simple batch Apex utility that allows you to check your CSV file against your Org's schema and tell you if it'll have any issues uploading (be it through Workbench, Data Import Wizard or the class itself.)

The idea behind this is the slog that uploading a set of data to an org, where you'll run into problems multiple times because of a mismatched field, extra commas or existing unknown automations (process builders, validation rules and triggers), without a way to quickly retry the operation with an updated CSV.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This is a work in progress, please make sure to **always** try these operations in a sandbox first. I'm not responsible if you create a bunch of records in your Production environment.

## Quick Start

- Upload your CSV as a static resource from within Setup
- Use the Developer Console to run the batch from the Execute Anonymous dialog, providing the correct parameters for your operation

```
Database.executeBatch(new DataUploadValidator_BATCH(<StaticResourceName>, <TargetObjectName>, null, <OperationType>), 200);
```
- The results of your operation will be provided in the final log of the batch.
